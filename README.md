# Qashio Dashboard

This project is built using [Next.js], [Shadcn], [Framer-Motion], and [Tanstack-table].

## Getting Started

First, install the dependancies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next (no pun intended), run the local development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the live project.

The project is optimized and better experienced on a PC, but it is still built responsive to an extent.
